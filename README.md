## ‚ú® Updates ‚ú®

**üöÄ Performance & Modernization Update (2025-07-01)**

This project has been supercharged with the latest features from **PyTorch 2.x** for a massive performance boost! ‚ö° We've integrated `torch.compile` to JIT-compile the model, slashing Python overhead and accelerating GPU computations. Additionally, we've enabled **TensorFloat32 (TF32)** to leverage the power of modern NVIDIA GPUs, offering near-FP16 speed with FP32's stability. The data loading pipeline was also refactored using PyTorch's native `DataLoader`, enabling parallel data pre-fetching to keep your GPU fully utilized. Enjoy the new speed! üí®
